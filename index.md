## 💡 About Me

I am a Computer Science student at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), driven by the goal of bridging technology and policy through research that advances transparency, accountability, and security in digital platforms. My core interests lie at the intersection of large-scale systems measurement and computational social science, where I employ empirical data to audit platforms and evaluate existing policy frameworks.

## 🔬 Research & Publications

### The Synthetic Stream: Prevalence and Engagement with AI Content on YouTube
**(Under review in ACM Web Conference 2026)**
- **Role:** Co-author (Equal Contributions)
- **Details:** Large-scale analysis of AI-generated content (AIGC) on YouTube. Collected a global dataset of 1.13M+ trending videos.
- **Key Finding:** AI-tagged videos gained 10.2% more views but 46.7% fewer likes. Viewing one AI video raised the probability of subsequent AI exposure by 51%.

### Security Evaluation of Agentic Browsers under Injection-Based Attacks
**(Distributed & AI Systems Lab @ LUMS)**
- **Role:** Research Assistant (Jan 2025 - Present)
- **Details:** Designing an experimental framework to evaluate DOM-aware browser agents (e.g., Perplexity Comet) against prompt-injection and jailbreak attacks across major social media platforms.

## 💻 Development Projects

### Distributed Key-Value Store with Raft-Based Fault Tolerance (Go)
- Implemented the **Raft consensus protocol** from scratch to ensure leader election, log replication, and **strong consistency**.
- Achieved fault-tolerant recovery and stable operation under node failures through durable log persistence.

### Document Retrieval and QA Pipeline (RAG) (Python, Langchain)
- Engineered a RAG system using BGE-small embeddings and a local vector store.
- Features **adaptive chunking** by document complexity and duplicate-document detection in ChromaDB.
- Designed a modular LangChain pipeline with a **Streamlit UI** allowing dynamic swapping of LLMs.

### Solar Panel Detection on Low-Res Satellite Imagery (Python, YOLO, QGIS)
- Built a two-stage, fine-tuned **YOLO pipeline** to detect solar panels in low-resolution satellite imagery.
- Curated and manually annotated ~330 satellite images of Lahore using QGIS/OpenCV.
- Improved detection accuracy by using **SwinIR and SinSR super-resolution models**.

### Web Application Security Hardening (Python, FastAPI)
- Implemented **OAuth 2.0 authentication** with JWT validation and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Eliminated CSRF and XSS vectors by applying CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and rigorous input sanitization.
