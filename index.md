## 💡 Auditing the Digital Ecosystem

I am a Computer Science student at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), but I view myself primarily as an empirical auditor. I treat digital platforms not as black boxes, but as public squares that need inspection.

My work sits at the intersection of **large-scale systems measurement** and **computational social science**. From analyzing transparency failures on YouTube to stress-testing autonomous AI agents, I build the technical evidence required to bridge the gap between digital policy and technical reality.

## 🔬 Research & Publications

### 1. The Synthetic Stream: Prevalence and Engagement with AI Content on YouTube
*(Under review in ACM Web Conference 2026)* | **Role:** Co-author (Equal Contributions)

* **The Problem:** Platforms claim to label AI content, but we lack empirical data on how prevalent this content is and how users actually engage with it.
* **The Method:** Designed a custom scraping pipeline to collect a global dataset of **1.13M+ trending videos** and 224k recommendations.
* **Key Findings:**
    * AI-tagged videos gained **10.2% more views** but received **46.7% fewer likes**, suggesting passive consumption but active dislike.
    * **Algorithmic Traps:** Viewing just one AI video raised the probability of subsequent AI exposure by **51%**.

### 2. Security Evaluation of Agentic Browsers under Injection-Based Attacks
*(Distributed & AI Systems Lab @ LUMS)* | **Jan 2025 - Present**

* **The Context:** As AI agents (like Perplexity Comet) begin browsing the web autonomously, they face "DOM-aware" attacks that standard LLMs do not.
* **The Method:** Designing an experimental framework to evaluate browser agents against prompt-injection and jailbreak attacks across major social media platforms.
* **The Goal:** To expose vulnerabilities where malicious text in the DOM can trick an agent into overriding its safety guardrails.

## 💻 Development Projects

### Distributed Key-Value Store with Raft (Go)
* Implemented the **Raft consensus protocol** from scratch to ensure leader election, log replication, and **strong consistency**.
* Achieved fault-tolerant recovery and stable operation under simulated node failures through durable log persistence.

### Document Retrieval and QA Pipeline (Python, Langchain)
* Engineered a RAG system using BGE-small embeddings and a local vector store.
* Features **adaptive chunking** by document complexity and duplicate-document detection in ChromaDB.
* Designed a modular LangChain pipeline with a **Streamlit UI** allowing dynamic swapping of LLMs.

### Solar Panel Detection on Low-Res Imagery (Python, YOLO, QGIS)
* Built a two-stage, fine-tuned **YOLO pipeline** to detect solar panels in low-resolution satellite imagery.
* Curated and manually annotated ~330 satellite images of Lahore using QGIS/OpenCV.
* Improved detection accuracy by integrating **SwinIR and SinSR super-resolution models**.

### Web Application Security Hardening (Python, FastAPI)
* Implemented **OAuth 2.0 authentication** with JWT validation and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* Eliminated CSRF and XSS vectors by applying CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and rigorous input sanitization.

## 🏎️ Beyond the Lab: Telemetry & Tactics

When I’m not auditing code, I’m usually analyzing different kinds of systems.

**The F1 & Automotive Enthusiast**
For me, Formula 1 isn't just about speed; it's the ultimate exercise in optimization. I am fascinated by the engineering wars behind the scenes—how aerodynamics, thermal efficiency, and hybrid power units converge to shave off thousandths of a second. I spend my weekends analyzing qualifying telemetry and reading up on the latest automotive tech, from ERS regulations to active suspension systems.

**The Gamer (Apex Legends)**
I spend a significant amount of time in the Outlands playing *Apex Legends*. It’s a fast-paced environment that demands the same skills I value in research: rapid pattern recognition, resource management under pressure, and effective communication with a squad. It keeps my reflexes sharp and reminds me that even in a chaotic system, strategy usually wins.
